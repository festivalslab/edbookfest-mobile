        "body":"<p>Despite the received wisdom of the book trade, writers don't have careers in the conventional sense. Each book emerges from a private imaginative landscape. But that's not a career, more a succession of leaps in the dark.</p><p>And yet authorship has become so professionalised that the language of the HR department now describes the writer's life. This is misplaced and inappropriate. Ideally, the writer works only for him, or herself, on their own terms. They have no boss.</p><p>All the writer can do is put one book in front of the last, and go back to the empty page or vacant screen. At best, the life of the writer, properly understood, is a quest for clarity and understanding in which every fresh start feels like an outrageous gamble against impossible odds.</p><p>Everything about the transition, from the solitude of the creative process to the raucous traffic of the marketplace, is chancy and provisional. This is as true now as it was in Samuel Johnson's day, though the explosion of new outlets has given the determined wannabe a greater range of options.</p><p>Last week, I opened an email from a writer celebrating her good fortune. When Louise Voss, a graduate of Kingston University's creative writing programme, found the book she co-wrote with Mark Edwards, <em>Catch Your Death,</em> rejected by countless literary agents, she decided to publish it herself using a new Kindle-friendly service that allows writers to turn their manuscripts into digital books. When her work prospered online, Voss made the transition from e (electronic) to p (print). Harper Fiction offered her a four-book contract.</p><p>That, you might say, signals a great beginning \u2013 let's hope so \u2013 but it could just as easily be a humiliating  conclusion. The market and the critics, and even Ms Voss herself, will decide. Either way, it's less a career move, more a spin on the wheel of fortune.</p><p>The Voss deal is instructive. If there is one good route up the south face of Mount Parnassus, it's the trilogy. Publishers love it if you succeed in this genre. In 2008, an unknown thriller writer, Tom Rob Smith, attracted a lot of attention with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/apr/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview29\" title=\"\"><em>Child 44</em></a>, which was shortlisted for the Costa first novel prize. He followed it up with <em>The Secret&nbsp;Speech</em>. The conclusion of this series, <em>Agent 6</em>, and the further adventures of Smith's protagonist, Leo Demidov, was released last week. For&nbsp;four years, then, Tom Rob Smith has had a career, courtesy of his&nbsp;hero.</p><p>If writers don't have careers, their heroes certainly do. Lee Child has Reacher; Ian Rankin has Rebus; PD James has Dalgliesh. This formula has held good for more than 100 years. Conan Doyle had Holmes, until he killed him off at the Reichenbach Falls,&nbsp;Fleming had Bond and, last week,&nbsp;the world's children waved farewell to Harry Potter. The juvenile wizard's career is now over. Ms Rowling, who celebrated her release from his spell by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/jul/04/harry-potter-jk-rowling-agent\" title=\"\">firing her agent</a>, now says with a sigh&nbsp;of relief that her life is just beginning, \"I will publish again.\"</p><p>Literary careers are the fabrication of publicity departments, but managing life and art is real enough. \"Books are good enough in their own way,\" wrote Robert Louis Stevenson, \"but they are a mighty bloodless substitute for life.\" Perhaps the urge to identify a career is an unconscious longing to invest literary life with flesh and blood.</p><p>Every writer has to reconcile life and work. \"My life has been in my poems,\" Yeats confessed in a letter to a friend. \"I have seen others enjoying, while I stood alone with myself \u2013 commenting,&nbsp;commenting \u2013 a mere dead mirror on which things repeat themselves.\" [Letter, 1888] Elsewhere, Yeats wrote that a writer has to choose \"perfection of the life, or of the work\". Every great artist who is obliged to confront that choice will come up with a different response.</p><p>\"Do you want to know the great drama of my life?\" asked Oscar Wilde, reflecting on his past with Andr√© Gide.&nbsp;\"It's that I have put my genius into my life; all I've put into my works is my talent.\"</p><p>More than a century on, we can see that Wilde was only half joking.</p><h2><strong>As one love affair ends,&nbsp;another begins...</strong></h2><p>James Heneage, former bookselling proprietor of Ottakar's, ex-Grenadier Guardsman and one-time member of the SAS, had been tipped to make a bid for Waterstone's but was pipped at the post last month by James Daunt. None of this, however, has dimmed his enthusiasm for books. As well as successfully launching the acclaimed Chalke Valley literary festival, Heneage has just completed the first of three volumes of a historical romance set in Byzantine Greece entitled <em>The Mistra Trilogy</em>. This, too, is highly speculative. \"I have no publisher, no agent, nothing,\" he boasts. \"Just 300,000 words of fiction.\" It's&nbsp;a start.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Julian Assange can still cause a bit of a stink</strong><br /></h2><p>As agents and publishers in New York and London count the cost of being unable to extract a meaningful volume of memoirs from the contrarian figure of Julian Assange, they might like to take note that in Australia they have found another medium in which to tackle this enthralling subject. <em>Stainless Steel Rat</em> is a dramatic \"Wikiplay\" by Ron Elisha, portraying the Aussie whistleblower as a genius who never showers, doesn't use knives and forks and cannot control his libido. According to one review, it's a satirical comedy full of sexual innuendo, that morphs into \"Wikileaks for dummies\" while simultaneously exploring the ethical dilemmas of secrecy-busting. Assange was always more promising as the subject of a drama or a movie. Perhaps Canongate and Knopf should publish the script.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" style=\"border: none\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/books&k=Books&k=Culture\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\">\n          <a href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/books/oas.html/@Bottom\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n              <img src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/books/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img alt='' src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Why+every+novelist+is+holding+out+for+a+hero+Article+1605849&ch=Books&c2=96952&c4=Books%2CCulture&c3=The+Observer&c6=Robert+McCrum&c7=11-Jul-17&c8=1605849&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: books/2011/jul/17/literary-career-heroes-robert-mccrum|2011-07-19T17:51:19+01:00|fb327ae0ef7b2cd9752dd4dfcdd9542faf2234c6 -->",
